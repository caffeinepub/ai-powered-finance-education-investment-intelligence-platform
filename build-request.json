Adopt a new signature color scheme — for example a deep indigo-black base with neon violet and electric lime accents, or a slate-obsidian base with aurora-gradient accents (cyan-to-magenta) — defined as OKLCH custom properties. Redefine typography scale, spacing rhythm, and border-radius tokens to feel editorial and premium rather than generic. All existing color token references (--primary, --accent, chart colors, etc.) must be remapped to the new palette so every component inherits the change automatically without file-by-file edits.",
