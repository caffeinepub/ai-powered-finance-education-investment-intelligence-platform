      "featureTitle": "Add a simulated real-time price feed mechanism to the frontend. In `frontend/src/data/mockStocks.ts`, add a utility function `getLivePrice(symbol: string): number` that returns a mock current price by applying a small random walk delta (±0.5%) to the stock's last OHLCV close price on each call, simulating live price movement. Export a `useLivePrice(symbol: string, intervalMs?: number)` React hook that uses `setInterval` (default 3000ms) to repeatedly call `getLivePrice` and returns the current price, the previous price (for change direction), and the percentage change since the session started.",
