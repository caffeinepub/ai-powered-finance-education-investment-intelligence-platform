  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements (REQ-26 through REQ-30). The core hook (useLivePrice), utility function (getLivePrice), LivePriceTicker component, LivePriceChart component, and integrations into StockPlaygroundPage and PortfolioAnalyzerPage are all present. However, there is one notable gap: the useLivePrice hook is placed in frontend/src/hooks/useLivePrice.ts rather than in frontend/src/data/mockStocks.ts as specified in REQ-26. The getLivePrice function appears to be added to mockStocks.ts, but the hook itself is extracted to a separate file. Additionally, the useLivePrice hook returns extra fields beyond what was specified.",
