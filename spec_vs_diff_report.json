  "summary": "The build request explicitly states that all core modules are already fully implemented and that no new requirements are needed. The diff shows various file modifications and one new file (AdvisorPage.tsx), but since there are zero requirements to verify against, there are no missing requirements. However, several new features appear in the diff that go beyond merely confirming existing coverage, including a new API Reference Page, password setup/biometric auth UI, and a getSummaryStatistics hook — none of which were requested even implicitly.",
