  "summary": "The diff implements most of the visual redesign requirements (REQ-33 through REQ-37) reasonably well, including the new color palette in index.css and tailwind.config.js, GlassCard aurora variant, TopNav overhaul, HomePage animated SVG hero, and micro-interaction animations. However, REQ-38 (new image assets placed in frontend/public/assets/generated/) shows no evidence of actual image files being added — the diff shows no added files and only references image paths in code. Additionally, the --anim-number-tick animation applied to KPI values on StockPlaygroundPage is not evidenced in the diff for that page specifically.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows 'Added: 0' files and 'ADDED FILES: none'. No image assets were added to frontend/public/assets/generated/. The code references these paths in TopNav.tsx, ProfilePage.tsx, and LoginButton.tsx but the actual image files are not present in the diff.",

      "reason": "The diff shows KpiValue component with animate-number-tick in ProfilePage.tsx and PortfolioAnalyzerPage.tsx, but StockPlaygroundPage is not among the modified files, so there is no evidence the number-tick animation was applied there.",
